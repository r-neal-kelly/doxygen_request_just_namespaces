# Doxygen Request to Only Have Namespaces in the Namespaces Page {#mainpage}

Hello, thank you for checking out my request.

Essentially, I have some constructive criticism about the namespaces page. I think only namespace entities should be listed on that page and no concepts or classes, or whatever other entities might be documented. It can be really useful to be able to see the tree of namespaces for the entire program without all the other entities getting in the way.

I think it's great that you can have one gigantic tree structure to see everything at one, but it should be a different page and not the namespaces page. Maybe the new page could be called "Entities" or "Labels". The "Namespaces" page should just be namespaces as it's rather confusing when the majority of the items on that page are not namespaces, but classes and concepts and what have you. After all, it's almost always the case that there are more classes and concepts in a codebase than there are namespaces.

I know that the tree in the namespaces page folds after there are a certain number of items, yet I still argue that removing the other entities from that page is a must, because there can be any number of namespaces inside of namespaces, to an arbitrary depth. The inclusion of other entities when trying to understand that depth is still very confusing.

Thank you for reading!
